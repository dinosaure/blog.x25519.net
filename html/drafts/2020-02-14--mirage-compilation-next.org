#+title: MirageOS compilation
#+date: <2020-02-14 Fri>

Into my previous article, I just showed up some internals about the MirageOS
compilation. However, the story is a bit complex. This article wants to go
further and it will describe much more details.

* A story about targets

MirageOS can compile an /unikernel/ to 3 targets:
- the UNIX target
- the Solo5 target
- the Xen target

For each, we need to a special link step to produce the right ELF file.
